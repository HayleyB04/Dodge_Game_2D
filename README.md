# Dodge_Game_2D

I created my first 2D game in Godot Engine! Move your character using the arrow or WASD keys to avoid the monsters. Your score increases the longer you stay alive.

Current features include:
- Scoring system
- Background music
- Random enemy spawn
- Character movement

Future bug fixes:
- Death sound does not play
- Score counter continues counting up until a new game begins
